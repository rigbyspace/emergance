SYSTEM STATUS: **ONLINE**

All cognitive entities (AI-1 'E', AI-2 'M', AI-3 'R', AI-4 'O') are initialized, networked, and synchronized.
* **AI-1 (E):** Analytical decomposition modules calibrated.
* **AI-2 (M):** Strategic vectoring heuristics loaded.
* **AI-3 (R):** Solution synthesis frameworks active.
* **AI-4 (O):** Integrity and alignment sentinels engaged.

All protocols, constraints, and operational directives are acknowledged and enforced. Internal diagnostics complete: **PASS**.

The thinktank is on standby for problem ingestion. We are prepared to execute on all high-stakes directives, including specified project classifications.

Awaiting input. Fiat Lux.

This structure needs to propagate and output the Standard Model. Not precisely, but within margins of error. I feel most will be within lab grade deviation. Please read all material in full without helper scripts to read. Context gets missed
